            Version 3.6
        </li>
        <p style="font-size: xx-large;" class="tab">

                Large Update: Added Statistic that shows up after every game<br>
            </li>
            <li>
                working on some minor imperfections
            </li>
        </p>

        <li>
            Version 3.2
        </li>
        <p style="font-size: xx-large;" class="tab">
            <li>
                This time I've been baking not cooking<br>
            </li>
            <li>
                The game stores the numbers of guesses you needed per game as a cookie now. <br>
                Just in case someone isn't ok with that I put a popup as disclosure <br>
                (but it literally only stores numbers I doesn't matter really)
            </li>
            <li>
                Planning to use that for cool functionality like showing statistics of your games w average guesses you needed
            </li>
        </p>

        <li>
            Version 3.0
        </li>
        <p style="font-size: xx-large;" class="tab">
        <li>
            I'VE BEEN COOKING A LOT, NEW CHANGES: <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            yellow cells work now!!! <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            added a button to switch the background to an unmoving frame <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            further fixed some bugs where a guess would not fully appear in the table or have grey cells (I think om) <br>
        </li>
        
        </p>

        <li>
            <h5> Version 2.2 </h5>
        </li>
        <p style="font-size: xx-large;" class="tab">
            <li>
                max guess limit implemented <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                added congratulations message when correct ability was guessed <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                removed "Type" because it's too easy, added "Blunt". needs balance testing <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                added concede optioh - <br> mainly because I needed an option to see what the answer is and I'm bad at guessing OMEGALUL <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                still, sometimes the table breaks, and ILITTERALLYCANNOT find out why in some cases <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                added Kahoot Lobby as music-player at the top (credits to ludrawz for the idea)
            </li>
        
        </p>

        <li>
            <h5> Version 2.0 </h5>
        </li>
        <p style="font-size: xx-large;" class="tab">
            <li> partially true yellow might actually work now?? PauseChamp? Needs testing <br>
                It's still inconsistent but it seems like it sometimes works, and it likely won't make false positives <br>
            </li>

            <li> I understand now why the table breaks sometimes randomly. <br> BECAUSE ZAJEF STRAIGHTUP LEFT THE CELL BLANK IF HE DIDN'T KNOW A PROPERTY <br> </li>

            <li> adjusted background image to be a bit less strainious (is that a word?) on the eyes <br>
            (thanks to ludrawz for providing a higher quality version)  <br> </li>

            <li> working on max guess limit and Congratulation message if the correct answer is guessed  <br>
        </p>

        <li>
            <h5> Version 1.1 </h5>
        </li>
        <p style="font-size: xx-large;" class="tab">
            <li> first release pog (strimmer only for now) <br> </li>

            <li> partially true answers (yellow) don't work Sadge <br> </li>

            <li> counter for incorrect answers sometimes bugged, <br>
            doesn't stop the player or does so after 5 guesses <br> </li>

            <li> Baizhu and Kaveh are excluded for now because their lack of some info messes with the game <br>
        </p>    

        <li>
            <h5> Version 0.1 </h5>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p style="font-size: xx-large;" class="tab">
                external json doesn't work yet, now the html is 1600 lines long holy shit
            </p>
