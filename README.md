# The Genshin Gaugedle, also known as ICDle
Based on an idea by [Zajef77](https://www.twitch.tv/zajef77), 
to make a Genshindle like guessing game, where the player guesses a character based on information about them, but based on more niche information related to TC (Theorycrafting). 
Zajef created an Excel spreadsheet collecting those datapoints related to character's abilities and started using the Excel sheet to play it as a game.
I thought it would be very nice to have an actual website for this game, similar to sites like [genshindle.com](https://www.genshindle.com),
so I used the information from the spreadsheet that Zajef provided and created the Genshin Gaugedle.
